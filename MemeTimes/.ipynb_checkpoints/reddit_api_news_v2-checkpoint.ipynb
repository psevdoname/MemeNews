      "There is one thing that is kind of mind boggling to me that nobody asks. The distance from Honduras to Tijuana is literally double the distance from Honduras to the nearest US border, in Texas. Why would they \"walk\" an extra 1500 miles to \"seek asylum\" in California as opposed to Texas?\n",
      "Jesus the media is having a fucking orgasm over this mundane shit.\n",
      "Well when a group rushes the border and there’s no real wall, then the options are basically:1. Just let them in2. Tear gas3. Melee4. Shoot\n",
      "What's there to investigate? [Mexico itself was using crowd control measures](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/honduran-killed-mexican-border-crackdown-migrant-caravan-181029130957107.html) against unruly migrants on their southern border (throwing rocks, etc at their enforcement officers). Google the name Henry Adalid, he was killed by a rubber bullet to the head in the midst of that.\n",
      "It’s used for crowd control. What else do you want? \n",
      "I'll have to check.... did they demand this after this happened under Obama's watch too?\n",
      "Use of tear gas at the border is incredibly common. https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-tear-gas-border-migrants/\n",
      "And if we made a standared where we dont just due to that what do you think groups will start doing as they did with making sure they where at front of the marches on the rouds as well.  They use them as leverage\n",
      "US border guards fired CS gas across the border to disperse the crowd.Everything else is gas politics (insert loud farting sounds)\n",
      "\"We investigated ourselves and found no wrong doing\"\n",

      "So lets say the findings of this lead to a War between the US and Mexico. I have to ask, how would the undocumented immigrants from Mexico living in the US respond. Would they take up arms against their Country, or against the Country where they are living. And what if China responded by telling Mexico we will help you, and if you win, we will give you back Texas and California.An interesting scenario. I sure am glad I have dark skin and can speak Spanish, just in case. My kids also.\n"
